# Introduction

ACSS (Atomic CSS) focuses on creating many small CSS utility classes for you to use in your HTML. It is similar to OOCSS in that they both recommend separating duplicate property-value pairs into their own rules. 

ACSS could be seen as a more extreme version of OOCSS though, as it encourages you to create styles at the smallest possible level.

```css
/* Colours */
.color-primary { color: blue; }
.color-secondary { color: purple; }

/* Margins */
.mt-1 { margin-top: 5px; }
.mt-2 { margin-top: 10px; }
.mb-1 { margin-bottom: 5px; }
.mb-2 { margin-bottom: 10px; }
```

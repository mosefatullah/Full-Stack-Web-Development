# Introduction

UI (User Interface) design is to create an exact design of how your application will look after creation (But this design will not have any functionality).

UX (User Experience) design is to research how logical the design is, how much user satisfaction it will bring and other critical issues (where a component is placed, the user can find it easily or how the color, font, text size, alignment of the application will not bother the user, etc.).

Usually, UX designers `design` the UI and also create a `prototype`.

## Designing Software

There are many tools available for designing UI/UX. Some of them are:

1. Adobe XD
2. Figma
3. Sketch
4. InVision

But, `pen and paper` are best way to start designing (it's flexible and easy to use). Also, you can use Adobe Photoshop for designing (old way and doesn't support prototyping).

# Introduction

The Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) is the foundation of the World Wide Web, and is used to load webpages using hypertext links. 

HTTP is an application layer protocol designed to transfer information between networked devices and runs on top of other layers of the network protocol stack. A typical flow over HTTP involves a client machine making a request to a server, which then sends a response message.

Communication between clients and servers is done by HTTP requests and responses. 

HTTP is specifically designed for transferring hypertext documents and other resources over the web. Other protocols like FTP (File Transfer Protocol) are designed for file transfers, while SMTP (Simple Mail Transfer Protocol) is used for email communication.

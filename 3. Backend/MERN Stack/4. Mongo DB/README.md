---- **MongoDB Introduction & Installation** (mongodb is a nosql language and non-relational database management system; it's useful for javascript developers, because it uses bson format (lightweight, traversable, and efficient rather than json) similar to the structures of json) (sql to nosql : table - collection, row - document, column - field) (locally installation - try free > mongodb local > mongodb community server > download; then read the docs - docs > server > installation > community edition > follow the processes)

---- **MongoDB Basic CRUD Commands** (Command of opening mongo shell : mongo) (default database - admin, config, local (don't touch)) (mongodb commands : show dbs - showing all databases, use NAME - create & switch to a new database, db - current database, db.NAME - create a new collection, db.NAME :- .insertOne({}) - insert a document, .find()/.find().pretty()/... .limit()/skip() - find all documents, .insertMany([]) - insert multiple documents, .findOne() - find one collection, .updateOne({}, {})/.updateMany({}, {}) - updating collections (find+update), .deleteOne({})/deleteMany({}) - deleting collections) (MongoDB compass is for visualization without any commands)

---- **Mongoose CRUD Application** (Mongoose is a Object Data Modeling for mongodb, it uses OOP, not functional; it's used to model the data as js object; Mongoose connects to the MongoDB server automatically, whereas MongoDB does not) (Benefits - abstraction from raw low level mongodb, relation between nosql data, provides schema validation, translation of data into object, 40 to 60% less code compared to raw mongodb package) (topics - schema design, mongoose model using schema) (CRUD methods : .find, .findById, .save, .insertMany, .updateOne, .deleteOne, .findByIdAndUpdate) (regular expressions are supported for finding data)

---- **Mongoose Instance Methods, Static & Query Helpers** (Instance methods - comes from class through instance; example - mongoose.Schema; also we can create custom methods into `mySchema.methods = {}`; can't access the model without the model instance) (Static methods - can be called directly without creating an instance of the class first; we can write static methods into `mySchema.statics = {}`; the model can be accessed by this keyword) (Query helpers - which are like instance methods but for mongoose queries; we can write helper methods into mySchema.query = {}) (Do not declare statics using ES6 arrow functions (=>))

---- **Mongoose Populate Relational Data** (working with relational data) (methods - .populate - connecting with relational collection & retrieves data) (aggregation - advanced topic)

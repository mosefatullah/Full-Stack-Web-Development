# Introduction

Coding and programming are not the same. Coding is a part of programming that deals with writing codes that a machine can understand. Programming is a broader term that encompasses coding. A programmer is a thinker while a coder is a doer.

A programmer has to try to find compatibility of real life with programming. His main task is to think logically to solve a problem. Every one of us is a programmer by birth. Now he just have to learn to program for the computer.

## Programming Languages

First of all, you have to choose a programming language to learn the fundamentals of programming. Then, you can move on to problem solving, development or learning advanced topics.

There are three types of programming languages:

- Low Level Language

  - eg. `Assembly`, `Machine`

- Mid Level Language

  - eg. `C`, `C++`

- High Level Language

  - eg. `Java`, `Python`, `JavaScript`, `C#`

Machine language is the only language that a computer understands. Assembly language is a low-level language that is a little easier to understand than machine language. 

Mid-level languages are closer to human language than machine language. High-level languages are the easiest to understand and write and are similar to human language.

### Choosing a Programming Language

_Have enough time, learn:_

- C
- Java

_Have some time, learn:_

- Python

### Fundamentals of Programming

Middle level programming is the best way to learn the fundamentals of programming.

Learn the following topics:

- Data Type & Variable
- Operators
- Condition or Decision Making
- Loop & Repetition
- Function
- Array
- String
- Pointer
- Memory Allocation
- Structure & Union

### High Level Programming

After learning the fundamentals, you can move on to high level programming. This programming is used to solve big problems and develop software.

#### Programming Paradigms

To solve a problem, you have to choose a programming paradigm:

- Procedural Programming

  - Line by Line Execution
  - Eg. `C` is by default procedural

- Object Oriented Programming

  - Objects
  - Eg. `Java` is by default OOP

- Functional Programming

  - Functions
  - Eg. `Python` is by default functional

### Object Oriented Programming

You'll learn 50% of programming if you find objects from something.

- Object
- Class

Other 50% is to learn how to use objects. There are 4 main concepts in OOP:

- Encapsulation
- Abstraction
- Inheritance
- Polymorphism

# Guidelines

<h3 align="center">C Programming</h3>

C is a middle-level programming language that combines features of both low-level and high-level languages.

### Why Learn C First?

- C programming language is a high-level language but very close to machine (low-level language). It is usually called mid-level language. So you can learn many functions of machine language.

- Only here one can learn how computer stores data and other deep things.

- To learn array, you need to understand pointers, which is not available in other languages and integral part of memory management.

- One has to have knowledge about character encoding from the beginning, which is not required to know much in other languages.

- String is not a direct data type in C. So it is mandatory to go deep into it. In other languages, string is just a data type.

- The language and the standard library are very small. As a result, there is more opportunity to improve problem solving skills.

# Introduction

Coding and programming are not the same. Coding is a part of programming that deals with writing codes that a machine can understand. Programming is a broader term that encompasses coding. A programmer is a thinker while a coder is a doer.

A programmer has to try to find compatibility of real life with programming. His main task is to think logically to solve a problem. Every one of us is a programmer by birth. Now he just have to learn to program for the computer.

## Programming Languages

First of all, you have to choose a programming language to learn the fundamentals of programming. Then, you can move on to problem solving or development

_Have enough time,_

- C
- Java

_Have some time,_

- Python

### Fundamentals of Programming

- Data Type & Variable
- Operators
- Condition or Decision Making
- Loop & Repetition
- Function
- Array
- String
- Pointer
- Memory Allocation
- Structure & Union

# Guidelines

### Why Learn C First?

- C programming language is a high level language but very close to machine. It is usually called mid-level language. So many machine language functions can be learned.
- Only here one can learn how computer stores data and other deep things.
- To learn array, you need to understand pointers, which is not available in other languages and integral part of memory management.
- One has to have knowledge about character encoding from the beginning, which is not required to know much in other languages.
- String is not a direct data type in C. So it is mandatory to go deep into it. In other languages, string is just a data type.
- The language and the standard library are very small. As a result, there is more opportunity to improve problem solving skills.

- While, Do While Loop
- Break, Continue & Goto

Step 4 - Functions

- Function Declaration
- Arguments & Parameter
- Return Value
- Function Scope
- Function Prototype

Step 5 - Array & String

- Array Declaration
- Array Traversing
- Multi Dimensional Array
- String Declaration
- String Operations

Step 6 - Pointers

- Pointer Declaration
- Pointer Operations
- Array & Pointer
- Memory Allocations
- Dynamic Array

Step 7 - Structures

- Struct Declaration
- Why Do We Need Structures?
- How to Use Structures?

Step 8 - File Handling

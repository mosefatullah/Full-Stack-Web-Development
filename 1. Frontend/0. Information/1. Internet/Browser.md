# Introduction
### What is a browser?

A browser is an application software used to locate, retrieve and display content on the World Wide Web, including webpages, images, videos and other types of files. Most browsers can be used to access information over the internet as well as local networks or files stored on your computer. Common types of browsers you may be familiar with are Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox and Internet Explorer.

### What is the difference between a browser and a search engine?

A browser is an application that allows you to navigate through websites on the internet while a search engine helps you locate specific webpages, images or videos based on certain keywords. Search engines such as Google are different from web browsers in that they provide an organized way for you to find what they're looking for faster by providing relevant results according to your queries.

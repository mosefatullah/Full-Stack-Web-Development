# Introduction

Computer networking is like having a group of friends who all have phones and can call or text each other. In computer networking, instead of phones, we have computers and instead of phone lines, we use cables, Wi-Fi, or other methods to connect them. When computers are connected to a network, they can share information and resources, like files, printers, and internet connections. This allows them to communicate with each other quickly and easily, just like friends talking on their phones.

A computer network consists of various kinds of nodes. Servers, networking hardware, personal computers, and other specialized or general-purpose hosts can all be nodes in a computer network. Hostnames and network addresses are used to identify them.
